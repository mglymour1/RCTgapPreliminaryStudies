Creates synthetic data with the same distributions as 2 major cohorts to estimate the effects of HbA1c on cognitive change.
Often it is not possible to move primary data sources across platforms. We aim to develop simulation code to mirror the key aspects of a data source without including any individual level data. This example is for estimating the effect of HbA1c on memory change.
